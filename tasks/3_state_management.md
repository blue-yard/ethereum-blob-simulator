# State Management Tasks

1. Create Store ✅
   - Define control state types ✅
   - Define simulation state types ✅
   - Set up state slices ✅
   - Implement state persistence (not needed for now)

2. Create Actions ✅
   - Implement control update actions ✅
   - Create simulation calculation actions ✅
   - Set up derived state calculations (partial, will expand with simulation logic)

Priority: Medium
Status: Completed basic implementation
